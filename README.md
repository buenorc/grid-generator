# Grid generator (with GUI)

## Rectangular grid generator for Delft3d numerical model based on closed landboundary file (shapefile)

The algorithm requires as input data the following information:

1) a shapefile (.shp) 
2) pair of integers related to the number of grid points (-1) in m- and n- direction (integers) 

The output file generated by the algorithm, ***grid.grd***, can be used in the Delft3D model. 

PS: The program does not provide the grid enclosure file (.enc) that can be generated automatically when the .grd is loaded and saved in RGFGRID (Delft3D model)

To run the code, the user must have installed the following packages in a Python interpreter:
1) Pyshp (shapefile) - conda install anaconda::pyshp
2) Shapely - conda install conda-forge::shapely

Additional packages required by the script are typically already installed in most Python interpreters (e.g., Anaconda):
* Numpy
*  Tkinter (for the GUI)
